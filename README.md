# Assembly Language-Based Academic Strand Assessment Tool

# Description
In our innovative school project, we have developed an Assembly Language-based assessment tool tailored specifically for incoming senior high school students. This advanced tool empowers students to make informed decisions about their academic journey by assessing their strengths, interests, and aptitude, aiding them in choosing the most suitable academic strand.

Our project leverages the precision and efficiency of Assembly Language programming to create a robust assessment platform that evaluates students' skills and preferences. This tool not only simplifies the decision-making process for students but also helps educational institutions better align students with the appropriate academic strands, fostering a more personalized and fulfilling educational experience.
